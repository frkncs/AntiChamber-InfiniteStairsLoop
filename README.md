# Infinite Stairs Loop System in AntiChamber Game

I made a infinite stairs loop system in AntiChamber game.
<br>Only problem is... <b><i>models</i></b> :D
<br>I'm not a 3D artist, soo... System working basically. If you use this system with good models, you have a perfect infinite loop system.

<h3>This system all about models actually... I know that, but still i wanna make this mechanic.</h3>
<br>
<p>Mechanic basically works like that;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have a trigger and player start point</p></li>
<li><p>If player enters a trigger, you teleport player to start point.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do this with perfectly matched models, it will be perfect. If you not, it will be like that...</p></li>
</ul>
